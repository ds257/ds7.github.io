I’m **Diya Saraf**, a Computer Science researcher and graduate student at the **University of Southern California**, where I work at the **Information Sciences Institute (ISI)**. I am advised by [Emilio Ferrara](http://www.emilio.ferrara.name/) and [Luca Luceri](https://www.luceriluc.it/), and am part of a team investigating how large-scale digital platforms influence public discourse and behavior.

My research examines **algorithmic auditing**, **coordinated influence campaigns**, and **misinformation in the wild**. I am particularly interested in how recommendation systems, synthetic media, and networked behaviors can amplify persuasive or harmful narratives—often invisibly. I combine approaches from **machine learning**, **graph theory**, and **multimodal analysis** to study these systems from both a technical and a sociotechnical perspective.

Ultimately, I am motivated by a central question: *How do we design and evaluate systems that shape public attention responsibly?*

### Academic Background

Before USC, I earned my B.S. in **Computer Science & Engineering** (with a **minor in Mathematics**) at **Santa Clara University**, graduating **Summa Cum Laude**. From **2021 to 2024**, I was a **Clare Boothe Luce Scholar**, a fellowship supporting women in STEM. Under the guidance of [Prof. Yuhong Liu](https://www.scu.edu/engineering/faculty/liu-yuhong/), I investigated **online trust, safety, and computational propaganda**, and co-authored a **conference paper on the impact of emojis on user engagement on TikTok**.

These experiences sparked my interest in sociotechnical systems, algorithmic bias, and platform manipulation—forming the foundation for my current work.

### Industry Experience

In industry, I have worked as a **software engineering intern at Dell Technologies**, contributing to both the **CI/CD** and **Encryption** teams. I built tools to streamline **automated deployment pipelines** and worked on **secure infrastructure services**, gaining insight into the systems-level challenges of building scalable, safe, and reliable technology.

### Current Research Threads

I am currently exploring:

- Auditing **TikTok and YouTube recommendations** using controlled sock-puppet personas
- Mapping the structure and temporal evolution of **coordinated multilingual propaganda networks**
- Investigating the role of **generative AI** in both enabling and detecting influence operations
- Designing what a **responsible recommender system** might look like in practice

My projects blend **data collection**, **modeling**, and **systems engineering**, with the goal of making platform behaviors more transparent and measurable.

### Collaborators & Mentors

I have been fortunate to work with and learn from:

- [Emilio Ferrara](http://www.emilio.ferrara.name/), research advisor at USC ISI  
- [Luca Luceri](https://www.luceriluc.it/), research advisor at USC ISI  
- [Yuhong Liu](https://www.scu.edu/engineering/faculty/liu-yuhong/), undergraduate advisor and mentor  

### Beyond Research

Outside of my academic work, I enjoy exploring **data storytelling**, **media manipulation**, and the **history of science and technology**. I am drawn to documentaries, lateral thinking puzzles, and creative ways of communicating complex ideas. When not researching, I might be cooking something ambitious, dissecting a tricky logic puzzle, or experimenting with a new platform—often to better understand the ecosystem it creates.
