Hi! I’m **Diya Saraf**, a researcher and engineer passionate about understanding how algorithms, influence, and infrastructure collide to shape our digital world.

I’m currently pursuing my **M.S. in Computer Science** at the **University of Southern California (USC)**, where I conduct research at the **Information Sciences Institute (ISI)** with [Prof. Luca Luceri](https://www.luceriluc.it/) and [Prof. Emilio Ferrara](http://www.emilio.ferrara.name/). My research spans **AI auditing**, **platform accountability**, and **coordinated information operations**—using graph analysis, machine learning, and large-scale multimodal datasets to uncover how misinformation spreads and how recommender systems amplify it.

Previously, I graduated **Summa Cum Laude** from **Santa Clara University** with a B.S. in Computer Science & Engineering and a Minor in Mathematics. From **2021 to 2024**, I was a **Clare Boothe Luce Scholar**, conducting funded research in online trust and safety. During that time, I published a conference paper on the **impact of emojis on user engagement on TikTok**, blending computational linguistics and social computing to reveal subtle drivers of virality.

Professionally, I interned at **Dell Technologies**, contributing to both the **CI/CD team**, where I built scalable deployment automation pipelines, and the **Encryption team**, where I worked on enhancing secure system architecture.

Some highlights of my recent work include:

- Auditing **TikTok and YouTube recommendation systems** using a network of simulated personas (“sock puppets”) to measure exposure to persuasive and harmful content
- Mapping **coordinated propaganda campaigns** on Telegram using multilingual similarity graphs and narrative diffusion models
- Investigating how **generative AI models** are weaponized for influence—and how we might reverse-engineer them for detection
- Publishing research on **algorithmic bias, digital persuasion, and AI-driven misinformation** at peer-reviewed venues

Beyond research, I love solving logic puzzles, watching investigative documentaries, and building data visualizations that illuminate unseen digital dynamics.
