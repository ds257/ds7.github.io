Welcome! I’m **Diya Saraf**, a Computer Science researcher passionate about machine learning, systems, and combating misinformation through responsible AI.

I’m currently pursuing my **M.S. in Computer Science** at the **University of Southern California (USC)**, where I conduct research at the **USC Information Sciences Institute (ISI)** under the guidance of [Prof. Luca Luceri](https://www.luceriluc.it/) and [Prof. Emilio Ferrara](http://www.emilio.ferrara.name/). My research focuses on **algorithm auditing**, **multimodal misinformation detection**, and **coordinated information operations** on platforms like TikTok, Telegram, and YouTube.

Previously, I graduated **Summa Cum Laude** from **Santa Clara University** with a B.S. in Computer Science & Engineering and a Minor in Mathematics. During my undergraduate studies, I was a **Clare Boothe Luce Scholar** (2021–2024), conducting funded research on online trust and safety, advised by [Prof. Yuhong Liu](https://www.scu.edu/engineering/faculty/liu-yuhong/).

My academic and industry experience includes:

- Designing **AI-driven auditing pipelines** to uncover amplification of persuasive or harmful content
- Mapping **multilingual coordinated propaganda campaigns** across social platforms
- Publishing research on **generative misinformation, elections, and influence operations**
- Interning at **Dell Technologies**, where I contributed to infrastructure observability and platform optimization

In my free time, I enjoy watching documentaries, solving logic puzzles, and building visualizations to interpret complex social systems.
