I’m **Diya Saraf**, a Computer Science researcher and graduate student at the **University of Southern California**, where I work at the **Information Sciences Institute (ISI)**. I’m fortunate to be advised by [Luca Luceri](https://www.luceriluc.it/) and [Emilio Ferrara](http://www.emilio.ferrara.name/), and to be part of a community investigating how large-scale digital systems influence society.

My work focuses on **auditing algorithmic systems**, **understanding coordinated influence campaigns**, and **investigating misinformation in the wild**. I’m especially interested in how recommendation systems, synthetic media, and networked behaviors can amplify persuasive or harmful content—often invisibly. I combine methods from **machine learning**, **graph theory**, and **multimodal analysis** to study these systems both from the inside and out.

More broadly, I’m motivated by the question: *How do we build and evaluate systems that shape public attention responsibly?*

### Academic Background

Before USC, I completed my B.S. in **Computer Science & Engineering** (with a **minor in Mathematics**) at **Santa Clara University**, graduating **Summa Cum Laude**. From **2021 to 2024**, I was a **Clare Boothe Luce Scholar**, a program supporting women in STEM. Under the guidance of [Prof. Yuhong Liu](https://www.scu.edu/engineering/faculty/liu-yuhong/), I conducted research on **online trust, safety, and computational propaganda**, and co-authored a **conference paper on how emojis influence user engagement on TikTok**.

These experiences sparked my interest in sociotechnical systems, algorithmic bias, and platform manipulation—and laid the foundation for the work I do today.

### Industry Experience

I’ve also worked in industry as a **software engineering intern at Dell Technologies**, where I contributed to both the **CI/CD** and **Encryption** teams. I built tooling for **automated deployment pipelines**, and worked on **secure infrastructure services**, giving me a deeper appreciation for the backend systems powering digital platforms—and the trade-offs involved in making them scalable and safe.

### Current Research Threads

Right now, I’m thinking a lot about:

- How to audit **TikTok and YouTube recommendations** using sock-puppet personas
- The structure and temporal evolution of **coordinated multilingual propaganda networks**
- The role of **generative AI** in both enabling and detecting influence operations
- What a **“responsible recommender system”** might actually look like in practice

I’m currently leading or contributing to projects that blend **data collection**, **modeling**, and **systems engineering**, with the goal of making platform behaviors more transparent and measurable.

### Collaborators & Mentors

I’ve been fortunate to work with and learn from:

- [Luca Luceri](https://www.luceriluc.it/), research advisor at USC ISI  
- [Emilio Ferrara](http://www.emilio.ferrara.name/), research advisor at USC ISI  
- [Yuhong Liu](https://www.scu.edu/engineering/faculty/liu-yuhong/), undergraduate advisor and mentor  

### Beyond Research

Outside of work, I’m curious about everything from **data storytelling** to **media manipulation**, **history of science**, and **tech accountability**. I love **watching documentaries**, **solving lateral thinking puzzles**, and **exploring visual ways to communicate complex ideas**. I also enjoy reading about algorithmic transparency, media studies, and internet culture. When I’m not at my desk, you’ll probably find me cooking something ambitious, deep in a logic puzzle, or trying to understand a new platform by just...using it.
